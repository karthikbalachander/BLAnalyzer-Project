# BLAnalyzer-Project
1.	About the program

You have a farm of 400m by 600m where coordinates of the field are from (0, 0) to (399, 599). A portion of the farm is barren, and all the barren land is in the form of rectangles. Due to these rectangles of barren land, the remaining area of fertile land is in no particular shape.

Input 
You are given a set of rectangles that contain the barren land. These rectangles are defined in a string, which consists of four integers separated by single spaces, with no additional spaces in the string. The first two integers are the coordinates of the bottom left corner in the given rectangle, and the last two integers are the coordinates of the top right corner. 
Output 
Output all the fertile land area in square meters, sorted from smallest area to greatest, separated by a space.
